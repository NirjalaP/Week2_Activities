<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
<p>Hi! I'm Nirjala Prajapati from Bhaktapur, a culturally vibrant town in Nepal. I speak three languages fluently: Newari (my ethnic language), Nepali (our national language), and English. I’m a big fan of momo, a Nepali dish similar to dumplings. Right now, I’m reading Atomic Habits to improve my routines. Back in Nepal, I loved taking hikes in the nearby hills whenever I had the chance. I’m just starting my journey to become a full-stack developer and am excited about gaining new skills and exploring opportunities in tech.</p>
